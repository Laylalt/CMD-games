Some games with python that I've been doing in my free time. 

### Tic Tac Toe 

Accepts two players, you can choose what symbol you want to use (X, O), and you can choose to quit or play again after the game is over. 

### War 
This is computer vs computer since these games usually take a while and everything is random (no choices to make) so it's faster this way. 

The deck is divided evenly among the players, giving each a down stack. In unison, each player reveals the top card of their deck—this is a "battle"—and the player with the higher card takes both of the cards played and moves them to their stack. Aces are high, and suits are ignored.
If the two cards played are of equal value, then there is a "war".

Both players place the next card of their pile face down (some variants have three face down cards) and then another card face-up. The owner of the higher face-up card wins the war and adds all the cards on the table to the bottom of their deck. If the face-up cards are again equal then the battle repeats with another set of face-down/up cards. This repeats until one player's face-up card is higher than their opponent's

### BlackJack

This is the most complex, it is multiplayer and you can choose how much you want to bet.
It is also incomplete, I still wanted to show it in case anyone wants to see the code since it's 90% done. 
I will updated the complete version soon, but this is something that I do in my free time and it's not a priority so I don't have an exact date.
